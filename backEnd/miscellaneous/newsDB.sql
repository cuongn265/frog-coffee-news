The requirements are in stark contrast to <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/dos-attack-on-major-dns-provider-brings-internet-to-morning-crawl/\">recent attacks targeting domain name service provider Dyn</a> and earlier <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/botnet-of-145k-cameras-reportedly-deliver-internets-biggest-ddos-ever/\">security site KrebsOnSecurity and French Web host OVH</a>. Those assaults bombarded sites with volumes approaching or exceeding 1 terabit per second. Researchers from Denmark-based TDC Security Operations Center have dubbed the new attack technique BlackNurse. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://soc.tdc.dk/blacknurse/blacknurse.pdf\">blog post published Wednesday</a>, the researchers wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>The BlackNurse attack attracted our attention, because in our anti-DDoS solution we experienced that even though traffic speed and packets per second were very low, this attack could keep our customers\' operations down. This even applied to customers with large internet uplinks and large enterprise firewalls in place. We had expected that professional firewall equipment would be able to handle the attack.</p> </blockquote> <p>BlackNurse harnesses data based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol\">Internet Control Message Protocol</a>, which routers and other networking devices use to send and receive error messages. By sending a special type of ICMP packets&mdash;specifically Type 3 ICMP packets with a code of 3&mdash;attackers can quickly strain the CPUs of certain types of server firewalls. After reaching a threshold of 15 mbps to 18 mbps, the targeted firewalls drop so many packets that the server behind the device effectively drops off the Internet. The researchers devised an attack that required only a single laptop to deliver BlackNurse volumes of 180 mbps.</p> <p>The TDC Security researchers wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>It does not matter if you have a 1 Gbit/s Internet connection. The impact we see on different firewalls is typically high CPU loads. When an attack is ongoing, users from the [local area network] site will no longer be able to send/receive traffic to/from the Internet. All firewalls we have seen recover when the attack stops.</p> </blockquote> <p>Over the past two years, the researchers reported, they have seen more than 95 ICMP attacks target customers inside the TDC network. The report didn\'t say if the ICMP attacks were based on BlackNurse or a previously known ICMP attack that delivers Type 8 packets with a code of 0.</p> <p>According to researchers from Netresec, a security firm that collaborated with TDC Security on the research, the attack works against firewalls from Cisco Systems, Palo Alto Networks, SonicWall, and Zyxel. The specific models and many more details are available in <a href=\"http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&amp;month=2016-11&amp;post=BlackNurse-Denial-of-Service-Attack\">this blog post from Thursday</a>. Palo Alto Networks has issued its <a href=\"http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/11/note-customers-regarding-blacknurse-report/\">own advisory</a> that reports company devices are only vulnerable in \"very specific, non-default scenarios that contravene best practices.\"</p> <p>Cisco, meanwhile, has reportedly said it doesn\'t consider the reported behavior to be a security issue, although the company hasn\'t said why. The networking giant might be aware of mitigations or limitations not reported by either TDC Security or Netresec.

For the channel, the miniseries is more than just a new show; it\'s part of an effort to rebrand itself as a source of serious, premium, science-focused content.</p> <p>So, while the series\' focus is a fictional drama about the Earth\'s first attempt at colonizing Mars, a strong effort has been made to be as accurate and realistic as possible. Fictional segments are mixed in with documentary footage from the present day, with experts talking about what it would take to get people to the red planet. The results make for decent TV, but suffer when compared to the recent film <em>The Martian</em>.</p> <h2>A quest for accuracy</h2> <p>In introducing <em>Mars</em> to the New York media, National Geographic gave more time to the program\'s scientific advisors than it did to the cast. And said advisors were an impressive bunch, including former astronauts, present astronomers, and a professor of aerospace engineering. Their job, as they described it, wasn\'t just to give scripts a quick sanity check; it was to make sure that <em>everything</em> was accurate.</p> <p>And not just scientific accuracy, although the show gets things like Mars\' thin atmosphere and the communication time lag between planets right. But <em>Mars\'</em> advisors also wanted to show that when things go wrong on the mission, the fictional crew responds like real astronauts by falling back on procedures and checklists instead of trying to think up a solution on the spot (this was mentioned to the media by one of the show\'s advisors, former astronaut Mae Jemison).</p> <p>For the most part, this authenticity works, at least in <em>Mars</em>\' initial episode. But a sort of overarching unrealism pervades the work. When asked about whether they thought it was likely we\'d land a human on Mars in the 2030s, every single member of the scientific advisory panel raised their hand to indicate yes. And several spent time during the ensuing discussion pointing out that we have the technology needed to get there already.</p> <p>Within the Ars brain trust there\'s considerable skepticism that anything of the sort is going to happen without a radical change in NASA funding and culture, the trajectory of commercial spaceflight, or both. And this series isn\'t just pre-supposing a manned mission; it\'s sending colonists. So, the basic premise of <em>Mars</em> seems to be a stretch.</p> <p>Promotion of that premise extends to <em>Mars</em>\' documentary portions as well. The head of the Mars Society, dedicated to sending people there, gets a lot of air time. So does Elon Musk, who\'s gradually filling in the details on his plans for putting people on the red planet in a similar time frame (we also felt that was unrealistic). In fact, Musk and SpaceX get so much screen time that I was afraid <em>Mars</em> would edge into an infomercial for the company. That fear vanished when it becomes clear that the show\'s illustration for how doing space is hard are all instances of Musk\'s hardware exploding.</p> <p>So, accurate as it may be, <em>Mars</em>\' basic premise requires either suspension of disbelief or some high-power optimism.</p> <h2>Drama vs. <em>The Martian</em></h2> <p>But plausible premises and technical accuracy only get you so far (they mostly help you avoid enraging the most knowledgeable segment of your audience). Pulling viewers in for a multi-hour series requires good storytelling, a building and releasing of tension. In other words, drama.</p> <p>In this regard, the timing of the series is unfortunate. While Ron Howard (<em>Mars\'</em> executive producer) can do space drama as well as anyone, the world has just been treated to a fantastic drama set on the red planet with <em>The Martian</em>. And <em>The Martian</em> didn\'t have to deal with contingency plans and procedures, given that the whole scenario in the movie was way beyond anything that could have been planned for. It made for great drama.</p> <p>Can <em>Mars</em>, with its large crew and dedication to realistic space missions, match <em>The Martian</em>? Well, it tries. Things go wrong in the first episode, and they go wrong in a believable way (it all comes down to a faulty sensor). But the incident ends up raising all sorts of other questions about realism. Musk\'s plan for getting to Mars involves a straight shot at the planet, slowed by braking in the atmosphere; there\'s no gently entering Mars\' orbit.</p> <p><em>Mars\'</em> fictional astronauts apparently have the option of aborting their landing, which means they must have had the option at least of entering orbit. But then it turns out that they only have enough resources on the ship to support life for a few days at this point (more are pre-positioned on the surface). This implies that aborting to orbit had a decent chance of being fatal or cutting in to a razor-thin margin of error. The life-support limitations then become a further source of drama once the astronauts reach the surface.</p> <p>All of which raises questions about whether realism is being sacrificed to create drama.</p> <p>None of which is to say that <em>Mars</em> is a bad show or that it won\'t get better as the episodes progress. But the first episode is mixed. The drama at times seems forced, and the documentary and fictional sequences don\'t mix together seamlessly. But there\'s enough potential here that I\'ll come back for episode two.</p> <p>Mars <em>premiers Sunday in Europe, and Monday in the US</em>.</p> </div> </section>',NULL,'John Timmer','Ars Technica',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4,'Mark Zuckerberg says it’s ‘extremely unlikely’ fake news on Facebook changed the election outcome','So what responsibility does the social network have as a media purveyor?',15,1,'2016-11-13 05:15:24','https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jb8kj2cZ2-JylOIyipYiF0JR2B0=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51807577/542774578.0.jpg',1,'<header class=\"entry-header\"> <h1 class=\"entry-title\">Mark Zuckerberg: &lsquo;Extremely Unlikely&rsquo; That Fake News on Facebook Influenced Election</h1> </header> <div id=\"social-context\">&nbsp;</div> <p class=\"p-meta\">By <a class=\"authorname\" href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/author/davidcohen\">David Cohen</a>&nbsp;<time class=\"entry-date\" datetime=\"2016-11-14T16:15:24+00:00\">on Nov. 14, 2016 - 11:15 AM</time><a class=\"comment_icon\" href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/mark-zuckerberg-fake-news-election/647416#disqus_thread\">Comment</a></p> <div class=\"entry-content content\"> <div class=\"entry-thumb\"><img class=\"attachment-entry-ethos size-entry-ethos wp-post-image\" src=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/GlassesMustacheNewsPrint.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" srcset=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/GlassesMustacheNewsPrint-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/GlassesMustacheNewsPrint-100x75.jpg 100w, http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/GlassesMustacheNewsPrint.jpg 640w\" alt=\"GlassesMustacheNewsPrint\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></div> <p>Facebook co-founder and CEO <strong><a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/facebook-q3-2016/646942\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Zuckerberg</a></strong>&nbsp;responded to the backlash the social network has received for its perceived role in <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/phil-ross-socialbakers-guest-post-social-media-predicted-donald-trump-victory/647332\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Donald Trump</strong>&rsquo;s victory in the presidential election</a>.</p> <p>Allegations have been flying about Facebook influencing the outcome of the election due to an abundance of fake news stories and hoaxes in its <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/facebook-q3-2016/646942\" target=\"_blank\">News Feed</a>.</p> <p>Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103253901916271\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> (embedded below):</p> <blockquote> <p>I want to share some thoughts on Facebook and the election.</p> <p>Our goal is to give every person a voice. We believe deeply in people. Assuming that people understand what is important in their lives and that they can express those views has driven not only our community, but democracy overall. Sometimes when people use their voice, though, they say things that seem wrong and they support people you disagree with.</p> <p>After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading. These are very important questions, and I care deeply about getting them right. I want to do my best to explain what we know here.</p> <p>Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.</p> <p>That said, we don&rsquo;t want any hoaxes on Facebook. Our goal is to <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/news-feed-algorithm-tweak-informative/643436\" target=\"_blank\">show people the content they will find most meaningful</a>, and people want accurate news. We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.</p> <p>This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully, though. Identifying the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.</p> <p>As we continue our research, we are committed to always updating you on how News Feed evolves. We hope to have more to share soon, although this work often takes longer than we&rsquo;d like in order to confirm that changes we make won&rsquo;t introduce unintended side effects or bias into the system. If you&rsquo;re interested in following our updates, I encourage you to follow our News Feed FYI <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/news/category/news-feed-fyi/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <p>Overall, I am proud of our role giving people a voice in this election. We <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/facebook-q3-2016/646942\" target=\"_blank\">helped more than 2 million people register to vote</a>&nbsp;and, based on our estimates, we got a similar number of people to vote who might have stayed home otherwise. We helped millions of people <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/vote-planner/646747\" target=\"_blank\">connect with candidates so they could hear from them directly and be better informed</a>. Most importantly, we gave tens of millions of people tools to share billions of posts and reactions about this election. A lot of that dialog may not have happened without Facebook.</p> <p>This has been a historic election, and it has been very painful for many people. Still, I think it&rsquo;s important to try to understand the perspective of people on the other side. In my experience, people are good, and even if you may not feel that way today, believing in people leads to better results over the long term.</p> </blockquote> </div>',NULL,'Kara

2620w\" /></picture></span></figure> <div class=\"c-entry-content\"> <p id=\"k1sTmx\">Over the past 24 hours, top executives at Apple, eBay, Box, LinkedIn, and Microsoft have all sent company-wide memos&nbsp;urging employees to try to move forward, and expressing the belief that people are inherently good. Others, like Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg, have&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13582008/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-president-statement\">posted public statements</a> about having to find new ways to work together. It&rsquo;s the kind of messaging that a company leader would send after a natural disaster, an attack on the nation, or a looming crisis within the company.</p> <p id=\"mgLMHj\">Only this time, the looming crisis is the president-elect.</p> <p id=\"GeoXHP\">The fact that CEOs are compelled to communicate with employees following this year&rsquo;s election shows how rattled Silicon Valley is. It&rsquo;s been an <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/11/9/13576446/ebay-ceo-memo-us-election-diversity\">\"emotionally-charged election,\" </a>as eBay&rsquo;s Devin Wenig wrote, an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@levie/quick-thoughts-on-the-election-77821a10a5a1#.d1792y6qi\">\"emotional roller coaster of toxic rhetoric\"</a> according to Box&rsquo;s Aaron Levie, the aftermath of which is <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/read-tim-cooks-email-to-apple-employees-after-donald-trumps\">\"leaving many of you with strong feelings,\"</a> as Apple&rsquo;s Tim Cook wrote. LinkedIn\'s Jeff Weiner wrote that \"<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-thoughts-election-jeff-weiner\" target=\"_blank\">polarization and open hostility was sustained for so long</a> that people with opposing views became more caricature than actual human beings.\"</p> <p><q class=\"center\">THE KIND OF MESSAGING YOU\'D EXPECT TO SEE AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER OR CRISIS WITHIN THE COMPANY</q></p> <p id=\"l5T7sK\">Sure, CEOs have congratulated president-elects before, and <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13585614/bezos-congratulates-amazon-and-washington-post-hater-donald-trump\">are doing that now</a>. They&rsquo;ve marked momentous and historic occasions with tweets and letters and opinion pieces. But this is different. This time, a presidential candidate has run a divisive campaign that simultaneously appealed to working-class voters and alienated many others who felt &mdash; who still feel &mdash; threatened by the racist, misogynistic, and authoritarian views he has expressed.</p> <p id=\"yHY4Jl\">More pointedly for Silicon Valley, Donald Trump&rsquo;s jabs at the tech industry have often been antagonistic. He&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/2/19/11588048/donald-trump-calls-for-apple-boycott\">called for a boycott of Apple products</a> over the company&rsquo;s dispute with the FBI in the wake of the San Bernardino tragedy, has accused social media companies of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/792734426912337920\">burying news about Hillary Clinton</a>, has <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/3139394/it-careers/at-campaigns-end-trump-takes-a-swipe-at-ibm.html\">called out tech companies for moving jobs overseas</a>, and has taken <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes-climate-immigration-health-care.html?_r=0\">an overt anti-immigration stance</a>, a stark contrast to the tech sector&rsquo;s embrace of high-skill visa programs that bring in foreign talent. (It&rsquo;s also possible &mdash; and perhaps likely &mdash; that some of Trump&rsquo;s policies could be beneficial to tech companies, like a <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-trump-can-a-tax-cut-for-overseas-cash-heal-wounds-2016-11-09\">so-called tax holiday</a> for the money companies have been hoarding overseas.)</p> <p id=\"Bxjgvk\">Arguably, these notes from top executives to their thousands of employees might have held more weight if they were sent out <em>before</em> the election, not as responses to an outcome. But doing so might have alienated employees, or carried the tone of telling them who to vote for. Some CEOs may have been concerned that vocalizing their thoughts around a contentious election would have impacted their business, although the particular irony of that will now be determined by how a Trump presidency affects the broader economy.</p> <p><q class=\"center\">SILICON VALLEY WAS CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED AND OPEN-MOUTHED IN THE WAKE OF A TRAUMATIZING ELECTION SEASON</q></p> <p id=\"S4bgxQ\">Even if they had expressed these thoughts beforehand, it still might not have mattered: Silicon Valley was, and still is, in its own echo chamber, caught flat-footed and open-mouthed in the wake of a traumatizing election season; building cool new products for people every day but having underestimated the extent to which people were willing to vote for a productized presidential candidate, one who at some level rejects their techno-utopianism.</p> <p>The notes being shared so far carry hopeful tones. Box CEO Levie reiterated the company&rsquo;s values of \"openness and inclusion.\" Apple&rsquo;s Cook said the company&rsquo;s \"North Star hasn&rsquo;t changed,\" and also included an inspiring quote from Martin Luther King Jr. eBay&rsquo;s Wenig said to \"stay focused.\" CEOs have a particular interest in keeping employees motivated to do work, and in offering the support that enable employees to do this. All of us, tech employees or otherwise, have to wake up, get out of bed, and go about our days.</p> <p id=\"5YQqft\">But it&rsquo;s the subtext and the context that are most meaningful: the fact that they&rsquo;re writing these letters in the first place. They want to remind people that their workplaces are diverse, and that they should show mutual respect for each other. They&rsquo;re asking them to work together in the spirit of generosity. They now feel compelled to tell their employees to just <em>be kind </em>to each other. <em>Please, let&rsquo;s be decent to one another.</em> This election season has brought us all to this point, whether in Silicon Valley, or anywhere else.</p> </div> </div> </div>',NULL,'Lauren Goode','Recode',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6,'Vudu\'s upgraded mobile app brings offline rental viewing','You can also watch extras, buy discs and AirPlay your videos.',11,2,'2016-11-13 06:47:00','https://s.aolcdn.com/dims5/amp:1e2655ec8979a0c479aa195a1603e11446c21baa/t:1200,630/q:80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F1e313ebe72146ea35f8d4112aa10104b%2F204580550%2Fvudu-ios-5.jpg',1,'<header class=\"o-feed_listing@m- o-feed_bleed@m- mb-10@m mb-40@tp+\"> <div class=\"o-feed_listing@m-__mid\"> <div class=\"o-feed_listing@m-__inner break-left@m- bg-white@m-\"> <div class=\"o-title_mark@tp+ bc-gray-1 col-10-of-12@tl+\"> <h1 class=\"t-h4@m- t-h1-b@tp t-h1@tl+ mt-20 mt-15@tp mt-0@m-\">Vudu\'s upgraded mobile app brings offline rental viewing</h1> <h2 class=\"t-d7@m- t-d4@tp t-d3-b@tl t-d2@d mt-15 mt-25@tp c-gray-3 c-gray-6@m-\">You can also watch extras, buy discs and AirPlay your videos.</h2> </div> <section class=\"o-meta_bar@tl+ mt-35 mt-20@m-\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+\">&nbsp;</div> </section> </div> </div> </header> <div id=\"page_body\"> <div class=\"container@m-\"> <div class=\"flush-top flush-bottom\" data-behavior=\"FitVids \"> <div class=\"o-article_block \"> <div class=\"grid@tl+ mt-n40\"> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div id=\"right-ads-rail\" class=\"hide@tp- grid@tl+__cell col-4-of-12@tl+ right@tl+ flush-top pt-40 relative z-1\"> <aside id=\"shared-ads-container\"> <div class=\"vc relative mb-20\">&nbsp;</div> </aside> <div id=\"taboola-right-rail-thumbnails\" class=\"mt-35 mb-35 trc_related_container trc_spotlight_widget trc_elastic trc_elastic_trc_52322 \" data-placement-name=\"Right Rail Thumbnails\">&nbsp;</div> <aside> <div class=\"relative mb-15 mt-25\">&nbsp;</div> </aside> </div> <div class=\"grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+ pt-40 hide@m-\"> <figure><img class=\"stretch-img hide@m-\" src=\"https://s.aolcdn.com/dims5/amp:030d6c8b91b128f84ac5c7780f7269c056d26db9/q:100/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F1e313ebe72146ea35f8d4112aa10104b%2F204580550%2Fvudu-ios-5.jpg\" /></figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"o-article_block pb-15 pb-5@m- o-subtle_divider\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+\"> <div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\"> <p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/02/netflix-offline-playback/\">some big streaming video services</a>, Vudu isn\'t sitting on the fence when it comes to offline playback.

In what we have to imagine is as close to a mea culpa as Apple is likely to offer, iPhone 6 Plus devices exhibiting flickering displays and touchscreen issues are <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/iphone6plus-multitouch/\" target=\"_blank\">eligible for a reduced-price repair</a>.</p> <p>Apple is careful to note that this problem mainly appears &ldquo;after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress,&rdquo; though <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/sufferers-of-iphone-6s-touch-disease-may-soon-have-a-class-action-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">iFixit suggested</a> that the problem could also be due to the phone&rsquo;s infamous <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/the-iphone-6-plus-gets-bent/\" target=\"_blank\">tendency to bend</a>. Either way, some force must be exerted on the phone, resulting reliably in a critical touchscreen component being damaged or unseated &mdash; and that makes it, like it or not, at least partially a user-caused issue. Apple declining to call it a design flaw or manufacturing defect seems to be a point of pride on their part.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"aside aside-related-articles\"> <h2>Related Articles</h2> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/sufferers-of-iphone-6s-touch-disease-may-soon-have-a-class-action-lawsuit/\">Sufferers of iPhone 6\'s \'Touch Disease\' may soon have a class action lawsuit</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/the-iphone-6-plus-gets-bent/\">The iPhone 6 Plus Gets Bent</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/16/inside-the-iphone-7/\">There&rsquo;s an Intel modem and an extremely skinny A10 chip inside the iPhone 7</a></div> Phones with Touch Disease will be repaired for $149, and if you previously had it repaired or replaced for similar symptoms &mdash; which might have cost you upwards of $300 &mdash; Apple will reimburse you the difference. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>iFixit pointed out in an email to TechCrunch that this price is about what third-party repairers have charged in the past to fix the issue, and considering refurbished phones are subject to the same problem, the 90-day warranty is rather short.</p> <p>Notably, the program is only for the iPhone 6 Plus, and although a similar problem has been seen on the 6, we can probably trust Apple&rsquo;s numbers and say this was primarily an issue with the Plus.</p> <div>&nbsp;</div> <p>It certainly took long enough: It&rsquo;s been more than two years since the 6 Plus was announced, and Apple never addressed the Touch Disease issue, despite it being quite common &mdash; and despite quietly reinforcing the next generation of iPhones to prevent the problem (the one they didn&rsquo;t publicly acknowledge) from occurring again.</p> <p>In fact, it was long enough that a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/sufferers-of-iphone-6s-touch-disease-may-soon-have-a-class-action-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit was filed </a>alleging that Apple knew the problem existed and failed to provide adequate support to affected users.

its Pixel today that not only look nice on phones but also change the wallpaper daily. The more logical of the cases is <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/google_earth_live_case\">Google Earth-themed</a>, which changes your phone&rsquo;s wallpaper to a different landscape photo pulled from Google Earth each day. You can press the shortcut button to learn more about that location, too. The live wallpaper magic relies on a NFC connection.</p> <p id=\"K5rtLY\">Okay, so the Google Earth case sounds nifty and perhaps even useful for discovering new places. Good job, Google.</p> <p id=\"AUFI1i\">The other new phone case is truly questionable. The Google Trends Live Case sets trending search topics as your wallpaper, which could get depressing real fast. For now, the cases are only available in the US and Canada, but the topics will change depending on where users are located. Double tapping on a trending topic will flip to a new one, whereas pressing the shortcut button will provide more details.</p> <p id=\"7CZVlo\">These are the trending searches in the US right now:</p> <figure class=\"e-image\"><span class=\"e-image__image \" data-original=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7490755/Screen_Shot_2016_11_17_at_4.22.04_PM.png\"><img class=\"c-dynamic-image lazy-image lazy-loaded\" src=\"https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxPqc8SRlymG1dTYizSy282QqmU=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7490755/Screen_Shot_2016_11_17_at_4.22.04_PM.png\" alt=\" \" data-chorus-optimize-field=\"main_image\" data-cid=\"site/dynamic_size_image-1483304422_4413_10477\" data-cdata=\"{&quot;asset_id&quot;:7490755,&quot;ratio&quot;:&quot;*&quot;}\" /></span></figure> <p id=\"obspZ5\">Would you want any of these to pop up right as you take out your phone?

The goal, CEO Brian Chesky said onstage at an event, was to give travelers guidance on what they are supposed to do when they finally get there.&nbsp;This has been in the works for a while. As of June, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/03/airbnb-begins-testing-city-hosts-program-to-give-guests-guided-one-of-a-kind-experiences/\" target=\"_blank\">the service appeared as a beta</a>.</p> <p>For Airbnb, at a company level, this gives the company another way to give a layer of interaction with the travel experience. That gives it a way to monetize additional parts of the experience, which could help it continue to grow into a more full-fledged company. While traditionally competing with hotel companies like Marriott, Airbnb can move beyond just being a booking and stay service into something more.</p> <p>If you&rsquo;ve traveled &mdash; domestically or, in particular, abroad &mdash; the process of figuring out what to do can be paralyzing at times. &ldquo;Go see this museum,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;you have to try the food,&rdquo; can be incredibly vague and generalizations of the overall experience. Airbnb wants to focus those down into more targeted recommendations for things to do.</p> <p>Airbnb users can basically craft these experiences &mdash; which in the app are displayed through a sort of carousel of cinematic posters &mdash; and sell them. Most of the experiences cost under $200, Chesky said. The experiences show a kind of preview for them before users end up booking them. Example experiences could be walking tours or lessons in astronomy in the area, the company demoed on stage.</p> <p>This, also, gives hosts the ability to make money beyond just booking their homes &mdash; or even in lieu of that. With the gig economy increasingly growing, this is a new way for locals who are experts in the area and good at building experiences a way to generate some additional cash on the side.</p> <div>&nbsp;</div> <p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1417836\" src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-17-at-10-14-12-am.png?w=528&amp;h=286\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" srcset=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-17-at-10-14-12-am.png 528w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-17-at-10-14-12-am.png?w=150&amp;h=81 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-17-at-10-14-12-am.png?w=300&amp;h=163 300w\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-11-17-at-10-14-12-am\" width=\"528\" height=\"286\" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"aside aside-related-articles\"> <h2>Related Articles</h2> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/guestready-raises-750k/\">GuestReady raises $750K to help Airbnb hosts manage their properties professionally</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/carousell-monetization-caarly-acquisition/\">Carousell prepares to monetize after acquiring automotive classifieds startup</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/airbnb-2016-diversity/\">Airbnb\'s female employee representation down since last diversity report</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/aibnb-sues-new-york-city/\">Airbnb sues New York City</a></div> Airbnb, beyond that, seems to be trying to capture the complete trip experience down to booking reservations at restaurant.

Eventually, a Chinese startup called Zero Zero Robotics released the $599 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/26/hover-camera-drone-zero-zero-robotics/\">Hover Camera Passport</a>, which comes in the unique form of a foldable cage while packing cool features like body tracking, face tracking and orbiting. I got to spend some time with the Passport over the past few weeks, and eventually it got to the point where I rarely leave home without it, lest I find time to take it for a quick spin.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"o-article_block o-subtle_divider\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+ left\"> <section> <h4 class=\"t-section-title mb-35 mb-15@s\">Gallery: Hover Camera Passport review | 14 Photos</h4> <div class=\"relative mb-n15 mb-25@tp-\" data-behavior=\"lightbox_trigger\" data-engadget-slideshow-id=\"458269\" data-eng-bang=\"{&quot;gallery&quot;:458269,&quot;slide&quot;:4268581,&quot;index&quot;:0}\" data-eng-mn=\"93511844\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/17/passport-foldable-drone-review/\" data-index=\"0\" data-engadget-slide-id=\"4268581\" data-eng-bang=\"{&quot;gallery&quot;:458269,&quot;slide&quot;:4268581,&quot;index&quot;:0}\"><img class=\"stretch-img\" src=\"https://s.aolcdn.com/dims5/amp:434f599d5e3536087a28baac9334caf3676aa9da/t:980,653/q:80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.blogcdn.com%2Fslideshows%2Fimages%2Fslides%2F426%2F858%2F1%2FS4268581%2Fslug%2Fl%2Fhover-camera-passport-2016-11-04-3-1.jpg\" /></a></div> </section> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"o-article_block pb-15 pb-5@m- cf@tp-\">&nbsp;</div> <div class=\"js-notMobileReferredByFbTw\"> <div class=\"o-article_block pb-15 pb-5@m- mt-n35 mt-n25@m mt-n15@s\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+\"> <div class=\"full-width@tp- grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+\"> <div class=\"article-text c-gray-1 no-review\"> <p>Compared to higher-end foldable drones like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/27/in-the-sky-with-the-dji-mavic-pro/\">DJI\'s Mavic Pro</a> and<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/03/gopro-karma-review/\"> GoPro\'s Karma</a> (assuming GoPro issues a fix for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/08/gopro-recalls-all-karma-drones-over-safety-concerns/\">random power losses</a>), the Passport\'s major advantages are its size, weight and caged propellers. At just 242 grams, or 0.53 pounds, the Passport is exempt from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/29/faa-commercial-uav-rules-now-in-effect/\">FAA\'s mandatory registration</a> and is also unlikely to hurt anyone should something go wrong, as its propellers are shielded by a carbon fiber enclosure. When folded, it\'s just 33mm (1.3 inches) thick, and even in its 45mm-thick protective case (which stores the drone and two batteries), it fits in my backpack with plenty of room to spare.</p> <p>Speaking of, I\'m impressed by the thoughtful set of accessories included in the box. In addition to that aforementioned protective case, there\'s a shoulder strap for it, a soft bag (just make sure you won\'t squash the drone), a second battery, a dual-battery charger, a USB 3.0 cable, four spare propellers, 12 extra screws and a pair of screwdrivers.</p> <p>Zero Zero Robotics is currently only selling the full drone package, but you\'ll soon be able to buy spare accessories as well, including batteries for $40 apiece. (In fact, the company will be throwing in a third battery plus free shipping as part of a Black Friday promotion.) From my experience, each battery offers a flight time of about 10 minutes, as promised, and it takes about 40 minutes to recharge each, so the more the merrier.</p> <p><img src=\"https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/887d0c75eaf7b11331d5048b2e3f6130/204576565/hover-camera-passport-2016-11-04-0.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-credit=\"Engadget\" data-mep=\"1435355\" /></p> <p>The Passport doesn\'t come with a dedicated controller, as it\'s geared mostly towards casual users. You\'ll have to download the companion Hover Camera app onto your <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hover-camera/id1160211159?mt=8\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zerozero.hover\">Android</a> device and then connect it to the drone\'s WiFi hotspot over 2.4GHz or 5GHz (you\'ll want the latter for better streaming quality; both go up to 20 meters). This is all very straightforward as is navigating through the relatively simple interface. As someone familiar with the basic controls for the DJI Phantom series, I tend to pick the \"Joystick\" control mode (my preferred mode) instead of \"Classic\" (up and down buttons for height and a four-way pad for horizontal direction) or \"Motion\" (a height stick and a toggle button for tilt control).</p> <p>Unlike most other drones, the Passport can only be launched from one\'s hand: Hold up the powered-on unit with its wings open, tap the power button to rev up the propellers for about one second, and then release the unit to let it hover. Similarly, you can retrieve the hovering Passport with your hand without ever having to worry about the blades: Grab it and tap the power button to kill the propellers, or you can first tilt the unit downward to slow the propellers down before tapping the power button. When the battery level is critically low, the drone can slowly land itself using the sonar sensor under its belly; you can also use the One-Touch Landing button to toggle automatic landing at any time.</p> <p>It\'s safe to say that the Passport is one of the very few -- if not the only -- drones that can be launched and retrieved so safely. This is guaranteed to impress your family, friends and strangers alike -- in my case, strangers include the security officers at Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport who were so curious they didn\'t mind me flying the drone inside the building.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class=\"vdb_player \">&nbsp;</div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Passport\'s camera features a 13-megapixel CMOS sensor that can capture video at 4K, 1080p and 720p, all with a normal frame rate of 30 fps. All captured images and videos are stored in the 32GB internal memory (my unit showed 22.6GB of usable space after formatting), and since the Passport is basically a Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/31/qualcomm-snapdragon-flight-drone-chip/\">Snapdragon Flight</a> 801 device running on Android, you can transfer its content to your PC in the same way you do with Android phones. With the exception of 4K clips, you can also download the content directly from the app to your smartphone.</p> <p>During my vacation in Okinawa, I captured all my Passport footage in 4K without realizing that only the lower resolutions support electronic stabilization -- a necessary feature since the camera hinges on just a one-directional gimbal as opposed to the three-axis gimbal on more advanced drones. I\'m glad that I did use the 4K setting by accident as, truth be told, even with the slightest breeze I was bound to see some shakiness, regardless of the video resolution. If it\'s a moderately windy day, forget it -- the lightweight Passport won\'t stand a chance. That said, braver folks may want to challenge Mother Nature by toggling \"Beast Mode\" for the maximum flying speed of eight meters per second (about 17.9 miles per hour).</p> <p>Back in Hong Kong, I found that it\'s only a tad better with electronic stabilization at 1080p resolution, but it\'s the loss in detail that\'s more noticeable. In some cases, I could even see some annoying warping across the frame due to the electronic stabilization. To put things in perspective, the Passport\'s 1080p clips have a maximum video bit rate of 16 Mbps (I get 17 Mbps from the Samsung S7 Edge and 20 Mbps from the Xiaomi Mi 5s) whereas its 4K clips are capped at a more impressive 60 Mbps (beating the S7 Edge\'s 48.1 Mbps and the Mi 5s\' 42 Mbps).</p> <p>Simply put, I don\'t think it\'s worth giving up the 4K sharpness for that little bit of stabilization; I\'d rather stick with 4K and use PC video-editing software to stabilize the clips afterwards.

There were a few still images which could use a slight boost in exposure, but that\'s an easy fix.

SpaceX chief Elon Musk first <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/17/elon-musk-spacex-internet/\">talked about</a> the project back in 2015, wherein he revealed that it would cost the company $10 billion and that it will operate out of the private space corp\'s new Seattle office.

They\'ll be orbiting our planet from 714 to 823 miles above the surface, higher than the space station that typically maintains an altitude of around 268 miles. According to the FCC filing, the project has two phases: SpaceX will initially launch 800 satellites that can provide internet services in the US and other locations. Once all 4,425 satellites are in orbit -- it could take five years to launch them all -- the array will be able to provide 1 Gbps connection to users across the globe.</p> <p>Besides providing details about the project, the FCC filing has also revealed the kind of power Elon Musk wields over SpaceX. Apparently, Musk has a <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2016/11/16/elon-musk-stake-spacex-tesla-shares/\">54 percent stake</a> in the space corporation, more than twice his 22 percent stake in Tesla.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>',NULL,'Mariella Moon','EnGadget',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13,'Japanese AI abandons its Tokyo University dreams','It is just not smart enough',12,1,NULL,'https://s.aolcdn.com/dims5/amp:2677ae38d4a22c008f80c7ba336d8ac4f45cff03/q:100/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fdims-shared%2Fdims3%2FGLOB%2Fcrop%2F3863x2578%2B0%2B0%2Fresize%2F1600x1068%21%2Fformat%2Fjpg%2Fquality%2F85%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F746c057c07a9d3ed42f59c6e13f6e284%2F204594618%2F523165090.jpg',1,'<header class=\"o-feed_listing@m- o-feed_bleed@m- mb-10@m mb-40@tp+\"> <div class=\"o-feed_listing@m-__mid\"> <div class=\"o-feed_listing@m-__inner break-left@m- bg-white@m-\"> <div class=\"o-title_mark@tp+ bc-gray-1 col-10-of-12@tl+\"> <h1 class=\"t-h4@m- t-h1-b@tp t-h1@tl+ mt-20 mt-15@tp mt-0@m-\">Japanese AI abandons its Tokyo University dreams</h1> <h2 class=\"t-d7@m- t-d4@tp t-d3-b@tl t-d2@d mt-15 mt-25@tp c-gray-3 c-gray-6@m-\">It\'s just not smart enough.</h2> </div> </div> </div> </header> <div id=\"page_body\"> <div class=\"container@m-\"> <div class=\"flush-top flush-bottom\" data-behavior=\"FitVids \"> <div class=\"o-article_block \"> <div class=\"grid@tl+ mt-n40\"> <div id=\"right-ads-rail\" class=\"hide@tp- grid@tl+__cell col-4-of-12@tl+ right@tl+ flush-top pt-40 relative z-1\"> <div id=\"taboola-right-rail-thumbnails\" class=\"mt-35 mb-35 trc_related_container trc_spotlight_widget trc_elastic trc_elastic_trc_57850 \" data-placement-name=\"Right Rail Thumbnails\"> <div class=\"trc_rbox_container\"> <div id=\"trc_wrapper_57850\" class=\"trc_rbox thumbnails-e trc-content-sponsored \"> <div id=\"outer_57850\" class=\"trc_rbox_outer\">&nbsp;</div> <div class=\"trc_clearer\">&nbsp;</div> </div> </div> </div> <aside> <div class=\"relative mb-15 mt-25\">&nbsp;</div> </aside> </div> <div class=\"grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+ pt-40 hide@m-\"> <figure><img class=\"stretch-img hide@m-\" src=\"https://s.aolcdn.com/dims5/amp:2677ae38d4a22c008f80c7ba336d8ac4f45cff03/q:100/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fdims-shared%2Fdims3%2FGLOB%2Fcrop%2F3863x2578%2B0%2B0%2Fresize%2F1600x1068%21%2Fformat%2Fjpg%2Fquality%2F85%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F746c057c07a9d3ed42f59c6e13f6e284%2F204594618%2F523165090.jpg\" /></figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"o-article_block pb-15 pb-5@m- o-subtle_divider\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+\"> <div class=\"grid@tl+__cell col-8-of-12@tl+\"> <div class=\"article-text c-gray-1\"> <p>A team of scientists from the National Institute of Informatics in Japan have <a href=\"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/11/15/national/ai-robot-fails-get-university-tokyo/#.WCwR8aJ97LJ\">given up</a> on making their AI smart enough to get into the University of Tokyo.

But in spite of its failings, it is having some unexpected influence on the industry at large. Valve recently tightened up its rules regarding <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/valve-tightens-restrictions-on-steam-store-screenshots/\">screenshots on Steam</a>, for one thing, which was widely interpreted as at least in part a reaction to the outcry over <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/the-worst-bullshots-in-pc-gaming/\">\"bullshots.\"</a> Now Geoff Keighley has told <a class=\"hawk-link-parsed\" href=\"http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/16/13649776/the-game-awards-2016-no-mans-sky\">Polygon</a> that he played a role in the hype around No Man\'s Sky, and promised that reveals at this year\'s Game Awards show will go \"deeper\" because of it.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"I have thought about the story of No Man\'s Sky a lot. Did we create this black hole of hype that the developers couldn\'t pull themselves out of? Some of that was authored by me,\" Keighley said. \"There is a good moral of that story and it\'s part of what I\'m trying to address this year; to have developers be more transparent about the state of their game.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>Keighley said he agrees that No Man\'s Sky fell short of its lofty goals, but also suggested that it was an inevitable outcome because gamers had \"an idealized notion\" of how the game would turn out pretty much from the moment it was first announced. \"I knew the team and it was eight guys,\" he said. \"The vision was never going to be achieved.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>As a result, new game reveals at this year\'s show will take a longer look at each new game that\'s announced, rather than just blasting through a 30-second cinematic teaser. \"I think people will be surprised at the depth of some of the game content we will show this year,\" he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2016 Game Awards will take place on December 1, and will be streamed live on Twitch, YouTube, Steam, and other fine moving-picture platforms.
